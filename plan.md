React Class Component

Key differences

- When using Class components, Hooks are off the plate!
- Inside a class component we must use the `this` keyword
- class components use lifecycle methods instead of hooks
- if the component needs a state, use a class component. If the component does not need to use state, just create a functional stateless component
